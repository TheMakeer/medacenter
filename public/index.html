        <p>
            This project is a tribute to MEDABOTS, as a nostalgic act to the good memories this awesome
            show brought to my childhood. I was not the typical kid fan of Pokemon nor Digimon, I never
            found them attractive, I would say that I engage more with robots, instead of fantasy
            creatures, and their designs really caught my attention plus the main concept that I find
            to be really well-worked. But as MEDABOTS seems forgotten (something that I can't explain
            to myself), I am creating this API for that little niche that still remembers this amazing
            show and that would like an API they can use instead of those that are already burnout
            due to extreme usage but that do not like as much as the majority. I do not want to throw
            some hate to Pokemon fans nor Digimon, but your show is not as good as you think.
